\subsection{Draw out what a neural network does. It splits the input space into regions that use different linear functions within}
\subsection{Is it sufficient to use ass the bias term in input?}
\subsection{Symmetric Mutual Information}
\subsection{Fast Decision Tree Pruning}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can you give an upper-bound on the height of the decision tree?
\item 
Noting that most nodes don't change after we push the update, can you make this faster?
\item Oblique decision trees
\end{itemize}
