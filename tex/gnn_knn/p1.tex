\subsection{GDA classification and GMM clustering}
We have $\data = \{(\xieg, \yieg)\}_{i = 1}^{m}$ where $\xieg \in \re^n$ and $\yieg \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$. $\data$ was generated by first selecting $\yieg$ in $\{1, 2, \dots, k\}$ using $\text{Multinoulli}(\bphi)$, $\phi \in \re^{k}$, and then choosing $\xieg$ from $\mathcal{N}(\bmu_j, \bsigma_j), \bmu_j \in \re^n, \bsigma \in \re^{n \times n}, j \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$, where $j$ is the label picked earlier. This process is independent for each example.\\

When the labels $\yieg$ are hidden (not available to us), they are denoted as $\zieg$ and we can run the GMM algorithm on the data to figure out which examples belong to which "cluster" (and not class as that is unknown).

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Set up the MLE problem, and give MLE estimates for parameters $\bphi, \bmu_j, \bsigma_j$. Do this by maximizing $p(\{(\xieg, \yieg)\}_{i = 1}^{m})$. Recall our discussion from \nameref{sec:gda}.
\item Now, let us say in the data $\data$, for very few examples, the labels $\yieg$ are missing. How will you label these examples for another downstream task that needs to be labeled $\data$.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Modified GMM Clustering}
We have data $\data = \{\xieg\}_{i = 1}^{m}, \xieg \in \re^n$. Consider clustering using GMM. We modify it slightly here. We now model,
\begin{align*}
    \zieg &\sim \text{Multinoulli}(\bphi)\\
    \xieg \ \ | \ \ (\zieg = j) &\sim \mathcal{N}(\bmu_j, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}_n) \quad j \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}
\end{align*}
Here $\bphi \in \re^k, \bmu_j \in \re^n$ are learnable but $\sigma^2 > 0$ is a \textbf{hyperparameter}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Write down \textbf{E. Step} (update of $w_{ij}$) and \textbf{M. Step} (update of learnable parameters) for this problem.

\item Using $w_{ij}$ computed in the above problem, show that in the limit $\sigma \to 0^{+}$, the algorithm becomes the K-means  clustering algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
